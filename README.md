## What is Bells?
Bells is a joke cryptocurrency referencing the "Bells" currency in Animal Crossing. Created by Billy Markus in 2013 right before Dogecoin and revived in 2023, it's Dogecoin's older brother. The shared "Nintondo" mention - a playful nod to Nintendo - in both genesis blocks underscores their sibling connection.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many Bells can exist?
Infinite.

But supply is effectively capped by the low block reward. Currently, with the block subsidy at only 2 BEL per block and a circulating supply of approximately 61M BEL, about 1M BEL are produced per year. At this rate, it would take around 430 years to reach a supply of 500M BEL.
