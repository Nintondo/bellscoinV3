Release Process
====================

## Branch updates

### Before every release candidate

* Update release candidate version in `configure.ac` (`CLIENT_VERSION_RC`).
* Update manpages (after rebuilding the binaries), see [gen-manpages.py].
* Update bells.conf and commit changes if they exist, see [gen-bells-conf.sh].

### Before every major and minor release

* Update [bips.md](bips.md) to account for changes since the last release.
* Update version in `configure.ac` (don't forget to set `CLIENT_VERSION_RC` to `0`).
* Update manpages (see previous section)
* Write release notes (see "Write the release notes" below) in doc/release-notes.md. If necessary,
  archive the previous release notes as doc/release-notes/release-notes-${VERSION}.md.

### Before every major release

* On both the main branch and the new release branch:
  - update `CLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR` in [`configure.ac`](../configure.ac)
* On the new release branch in [`configure.ac`](../configure.ac):
  - set `CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR` to `0`
  - set `CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD` to `0`
  - set `CLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` to `true`

#### Before branch-off

* Update translations.
* Update hardcoded [seeds](/contrib/seeds/README.md).
* Update the following variables in [`src/kernel/chainparams.cpp`](/src/kernel/chainparams.cpp) for mainnet, testnet, and signet:
  - `m_assumed_blockchain_size` and `m_assumed_chain_state_size` with the current size plus some overhead (see
    [this](#how-to-calculate-assumed-blockchain-and-chain-state-size) for information on how to calculate them).
  - The following updates should be reviewed with `reindex-chainstate` and `assumevalid=0` to catch any defect
    that causes rejection of blocks in the past history.
  - `chainTxData` with statistics about the transaction count and rate. Use the output of the `getchaintxstats` RPC with an
    `nBlocks` of 40320 (28 days) and a `bestblockhash` of RPC `getbestblockhash`;
     Reviewers can verify the results by running
    `getchaintxstats <window_block_count> <window_final_block_hash>` with the `window_block_count` and `window_final_block_hash` from your output.
  - `defaultAssumeValid` with the output of RPC `getblockhash` using the `height` of `window_final_block_height` above
    (and update the block height comment with that height), taking into account the following:
    - On mainnet, the selected value must not be orphaned, so it may be useful to set the height two blocks back from the tip.
    - Testnet should be set with a height some tens of thousands back from the tip, due to reorgs there.
  - `nMinimumChainWork` with the "chainwork" value of RPC `getblockheader` using the same height as that selected for the previous step.
* Consider updating the headers synchronization tuning parameters to account for the chainparams updates.
  The optimal values change very slowly, so this isn't strictly necessary every release, but doing so doesn't hurt.
  - Update configuration variables in [`contrib/devtools/headerssync-params.py`](/contrib/devtools/headerssync-params.py):
    - Set `TIME` to the software's expected supported lifetime -- after this time, its ability to defend against a high bandwidth timewarp attacker will begin to degrade.
    - Set `MINCHAINWORK_HEADERS` to the height used for the `nMinimumChainWork` calculation above.
    - Check that the other variables still look reasonable.
  - Run the script. It works fine in CPython, but PyPy is much faster (seconds instead of minutes): `pypy3 contrib/devtools/headerssync-params.py`.
  - Paste the output defining `HEADER_COMMITMENT_PERIOD` and `REDOWNLOAD_BUFFER_SIZE` into the top of [`src/headerssync.cpp`](/src/headerssync.cpp).
- Clear the release notes and move them to the wiki (see "Write the release notes" below).

#### After branch-off (on the major release branch)

- Update the versions.
- Clear the release notes: `cp doc/release-notes-empty-template.md doc/release-notes.md`
- Create a pinned meta-issue for testing the release candidate and provide a link to it in the release announcements where useful.

## Building

### First time / New builders

Install Guix using one of the installation methods detailed in
[contrib/guix/INSTALL.md](/contrib/guix/INSTALL.md).

### Setup and perform Guix builds

Checkout the Bells Core version you'd like to build:

```sh
pushd ./bells
SIGNER='(your builder key, ie bluematt, sipa, etc)'
VERSION='(new version without v-prefix, e.g. 3.0)'
git fetch origin "v${VERSION}"
git checkout "v${VERSION}"
popd
```

Ensure your guix.sigs are up-to-date if you wish to `guix-verify` your builds
against other `guix-attest` signatures.

```sh
git -C ./guix.sigs pull
```

### Create the macOS SDK tarball (first time, or when SDK version changes)

Create the macOS SDK tarball, see the [macdeploy
instructions](/contrib/macdeploy/README.md#deterministic-macos-app-notes) for
details.

### Build and attest to build outputs

Follow the relevant Guix README.md sections:
- [Building](/contrib/guix/README.md#building)
- [Attesting to build outputs](/contrib/guix/README.md#attesting-to-build-outputs)


### Additional information

#### <a name="how-to-calculate-assumed-blockchain-and-chain-state-size"></a>How to calculate `m_assumed_blockchain_size` and `m_assumed_chain_state_size`

Both variables are used as a guideline for how much space the user needs on their drive in total, not just strictly for the blockchain.
Note that all values should be taken from a **fully synced** node and have an overhead of 5-10% added on top of its base value.

To calculate `m_assumed_blockchain_size`, take the size in GiB of these directories:
- For `mainnet` -> the data directory, excluding the `/testnet`, `/signet`, and `/regtest` directories and any overly large files, e.g. a huge `debug.log`
- For `testnet` -> `/testnet`

To calculate `m_assumed_chain_state_size`, take the size in GiB of these directories:
- For `mainnet` -> `/chainstate`
- For `testnet` -> `/testnet/chainstate`

Notes:
- When taking the size for `m_assumed_blockchain_size`, there's no need to exclude the `/chainstate` directory since it's a guideline value and an overhead will be added anyway.
- The expected overhead for growth may change over time. Consider whether the percentage needs to be changed in response; if so, update it here in this section.
